            <p>"Miao Ying's Blind Spot (2007) is an 1869-page Mandarin dictionary that has been manually annotated to indicate 2,000 search terms that were censored in China at the time. To make the list, Miao took on the labor-intensive task of searching every word on google.cn. If the search results returned with “According to local laws, some search results are not showing,” in the bottom of the page, Miao would erase the word with white tape.
              The words on Miao's list are sometimes predictable terms related to politics or religion. Other times they are surprising, words that had been flagged temporarily for indiscernable reasons.
              Blind Spot (2007) is a meditation on the conditions of the Chinese internet, particularly on the experience of the country's heavy censorship. The work also comments on the human labor required for those who maintain the apparatus of regulatory state control, and of those subject to it.
              Blind Spot marked the beginning of the artist's interest in considering censorship in her work. But it also sparked her interest in censorship beyond itself; instead considering her relationship to it as a user."
