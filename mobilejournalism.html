            <p>"Mobile Journalism is a VR installation that forces visitors to question the validity of their opinions if the information we are presented with is often manipulated or from a biased perspective.
              Designed by Design Academy Eindhoven graduate Jim Brady, a VR scene shows a protest march from multiple perspectives. Using a controller, you can alter your perspective of a single scene and play the role of the police officer, journalist or protestor and empathise with each conflicting viewpoint.
              Brady believes that in this information age, we are quick to formulate an opinion based on what is published, and emphasises that breaking news is never neutral.
              His hope is that visitors will take a more critical approach to news stories that they hear, see and read as there is never a singular narrative."
