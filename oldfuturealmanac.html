        "For the eagle-eyed reader out there, it's possible that you might notice that this book looks an awful lot like the Old Farmer's Almanac, a staple of apple pie-cooling-on-the-windowsill Americana since 1792.
        The Old Farmer's Almanac purpose for existing rests largely on tradition, and tradition, as we have seen with the dismantling of many monuments to some of U.S. history's greatest monsters, is long overdue for a reckoning. 
        Social forecasters spin, but how could they possibly predict anything under such conditions? If we add other factors to this inexhaustible media hunger - the epistemological efficiency of the doctrine of Donald Trump (permitting a reality of one's choosing), the ELASTIC TIME that has been an attribute of our COVID quarantine (bringing your job's time theft clauses into your living space), and, of course, the real changes that are happening on Earth as a result of climate change - we have not only a real mess, but also the seeds of a pretty grim looking future. AND YET! This possible future can still be the OLD FUTURE. Perhaps we can better understand the OLD FUTURE by really diving into its tenets. This is the purpose of this little booklet, a tiny excavation into the much of the OLD FUTURE, not to bum you out in a playful way, but instead to suggest that other, better, different, and possible NEW FUTURES are in reach if we can just muster up the vision to imagine them."
