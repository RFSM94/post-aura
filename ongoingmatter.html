            <p>"Ongoing Matter: Design, Democracy, and the Mueller Report is a nonpartisan, grassroots design initiative fostering audience engagement with the Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, or, as it is more colloquially known, the Mueller Report.</p>
            The multi-platform exhibition of contemporary design artifacts, including posters, brings the words of the report to life visually, making the text more approachable and providing entry points for learning more about the report content.
            Ongoing Matter also calls average citizens to respond to what has become one of the most consequential political moments in modern history—a moment when the integrity of American elections and democracy itself is at risk—by reading Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s words.
            The artists and designers in this project consider their charge to be one of empowerment, using the art of communication design to 1) reveal, inform, and spur audiences to act and 2) combat widespread misinformation and disinformation. These interpretive, political works also illuminate the major threats to democracy cited in the Mueller Report."</p>
