        <p>"It is precisely in this last solo exhibition that Thomas Hirschhorn questions, through a new series of collages, a particular aspect of this problematic, which he names the aesthetic of the «faceless» – particularly, the increasingly common use by the media of pixels covering and censoring parts of images in order to hide mutilated bodies in war scenes.
        Generally speaking, these are photos by anonymous authors, which contain scenes of extreme violence, published on the Internet by witnesses, activists, aid workers, security agents and police officers, as well as by the fighters themselves. Hirschhorn appropriates them and enlarges them up to a scale typical of advertising billboards, proceeding afterwards with a work of collage of abstract areas, similar to the pixelating effect used over portions of the original photographic information.
        In many of them, the horror is left uncovered and only portions of the collage with fashion images are pixelated. The growing use of that filter interests him because pixelating and blurring are currently understood as a guarantee of authenticity – as if, in order to be authentic, certain images need to be partially pixelated.
        Making no excuses for arguments concerning hypersensitivity, the artist claims that that is the precise reason why it’s important to see those images of dead bodies, for it implies a commitment of a stance against war."
